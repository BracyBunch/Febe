Our primary goal is to provide you with exceptional service, and we understand that you may have questions or concerns regarding your personal information and how it will be used. To make this privacy policy easy to find, we make it available from the home page of our website at pixbi.com (the "website") and through our mobile applications. You may also email us or write us at the addresses shown in the last paragraph of this Privacy Policy with any privacy-related questions you have.

We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.

HOW WE USE COOKIES

When you access our Service, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called "cookies" on your computer.

For example, we send a "cookie" to your computer any time you log in to your Pixbi account. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don"t need to ask you for your password on each page. Most browsers are set up initially to accept cookies but you may reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent. Doing so could inhibit the use of the Service.


HOW WE PROTECT & STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION

We store and process your personal information using third party servers located in secure data centers in the United States. This information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts.

If Pixbi learns of a systems security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Pixbi Service, you agree that Pixbi may communicate with you electronically. Pixbi may post a notice on the Website if a security breach occurs.
