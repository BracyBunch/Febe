DISPUTES

Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of Good In This World, or to any products or services sold or distributed through Good In This World will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. The term “dispute” means any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and Good In This World, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. “Dispute” will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Good In This World, at 379 West Broadway, New York, NY 10012 , Attention: Good In This World. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA"s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA"s rules are currently available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA"s rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.

We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.No arbitration proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute under these Terms of Use must be filed within one year in an arbitration proceeding. The one-year period begins when the claim or first could be filed. If a claim or dispute isn"t filed within one year, it"s permanently barred.

THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION “DISPUTES” DO NOT APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS OR ATIONS RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF Good In This World’S OR Good In This World’S LICENSORS’ INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.


APPLICABLE LAW

You agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of New York, without regard to principles of conflict of laws of such State, will govern these Terms of Use and the other Good In This World Policies and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Good In This World. You and we irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in the Borough of Manhattan, New York County, New York State, for all disputes arising out of or relating to this agreement or the services that may be heard in court.
